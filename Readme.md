# Screen2braille

## 💡 Inspiration

We wanted to have an application which can summarize a given website and can help us to grasp the information quickly. But the application would have a drawback where people with disability could not use it.   

So we created **Screen2braille** which summarizes the text available on the user's browser window and converts it into braille script through IoT by using servo which makes buldges and the characters of the braille is formed as well as has a text to speech system in place.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app **Screen2braille** is built with the following features:
- Text to speech.
- Braille formation using servo.
